# Medicare Fraud Detection - DATA 606 Capstone (Team D)

This repository contains code, data, and documentation for our DATA 606 Capstone project titled:  
**"Fraud Detection in Medicare Claims Using Machine Learning and AI Agents"**

## Team Members
- Shebeta Alemu
- Shanwen Yu

## Project Overview
We aim to build a machine learning model that flags potentially fraudulent healthcare providers based on Medicare claim data. The project incorporates:

- Supervised classification models
- Text mining of procedure descriptions
- Large Language Model (LLM) explanations using GPT-4
- Optional LangChain-based AI agent for querying results
